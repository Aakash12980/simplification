The release is postponed due to the complexion of integrating my code into the current (newer) version of Joshua, as well as my job search in the spring that I was honored to be invited for interivew by 14 universities. Now, I am catching up with things and expect to have everying wrapped up after ACL around the end of August. If you want to be notified by email when it's released, please send me a note (xwe@cis.upenn.edu).
